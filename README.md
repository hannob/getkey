# getkey
Bruteforce-search private keys in larger files

This is a very simple python script that will look for DER-encoded private
keys embedded in other files.

A typical example are private keys that are part of applications and
embedded in an EXE file.

(Note: This is an old script that was written for python 2, it would
need some adaption to work with python 3. Pull requests wellcome.)
